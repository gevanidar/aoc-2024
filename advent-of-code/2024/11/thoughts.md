# b

So and idea is to check expansion of 0 and replace it with known values of stones generated for each step (since 
it would be fair to assume we will be generation from it a lot.)

0: 
1 step: 1 (1)
2 step: 1 (2024)
3 step: 2 (20 24)
4 step: 4 (2 _0_ 2 4)
...

This loop will probably be the most common from the algorithm
